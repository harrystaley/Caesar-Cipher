# Caesar-Cipher

## Overview
The Caesar-Cipher project is a Python implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher encryption technique. This repository adheres to PEP8 standards, ensuring that the code is clean and maintainable. The implementation is straightforward, making it easy for beginners and seasoned developers alike to understand and utilize this cryptographic method. This project is inspired by various community discussions and examples, aiming to provide a practical approach to learning about encryption through a historical cipher.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Caesar-Cipher.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Caesar-Cipher
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the Caesar Cipher, you can import the `caesar_cipher` function from the `caesar_cipher.py` file and use it to encrypt or decrypt messages. Here is a basic example:

```python
from caesar_cipher import caesar_cipher

# Encrypting a message
encrypted_message = caesar_cipher("Hello, World!", 3)
print("Encrypted:", encrypted_message)

# Decrypting a message
decrypted_message = caesar_cipher(encrypted_message, -3)
print("Decrypted:", decrypted_message)
```

For more detailed examples, refer to the `examples.py` file.
